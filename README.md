{Meow} the A.I. Cat is a real-time motion detection in-browser app that allows you to quickly and interactively train a computer vision system aka Cat. When your are clicking on training buttons defining three classes of actions you are taking photos(examples)for that specific action. Next time when a webcam captures your action it will compare it with the ones previously acquired and once common items are found it will respond by playing a certain GIF.

What happens in the background is the use of Javascript, Tesorflow.js and Deeplearn.js library. It gets loaded inside of the browser and uses its local storage capabilities so that everything is performed and kept solely on the client side.
